# slepemapy.cz

The dataset contains answers from online application http://slepemapy.cz. The application allows the users to practice location of places (countries, cities etc.).

## How Was the Dataset Created?

Firstly, the raw data was obtained from:
* www.slepemapy.cz/csv/answer
* www.slepemapy.cz/csv/answer_options
* www.slepemapy.cz/csv/place

and then:

```python
import proso.geography.answers
import proso.geography.dfutil

data_all = proso.geography.answers.from_csv(
    "geography.answer.csv",
    answer_options_csv="geography.answer_options.csv")
data_all = proso.geography.answers.apply_filter(
    data_all,
    lambda x: x['number_of_options'] == len(x['options']))
data_all.drop('test_id', axis=1, inplace=True)
data_all = proso.geography.answers.anonymize(data_all)
data_train, data_test = proso.geography.answers.sample(data_all, 0.5)

data_place = proso.geography.dfutil.load_csv("./geography.place.csv").drop('name', axis=1)

data_all.to_csv("answers_all.csv", index=False)
data_test.to_csv("answers_test.csv", index=False)
data_train.to_csv("answers_train.csv", index=False)
data_place.to_csv("places.csv", index=False)
```
